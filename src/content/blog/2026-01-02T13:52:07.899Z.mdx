Today I Learned: Another visiting shinto shrine style, Sai-saki-moude (幸先詣)

People in Japan commonly visit shrine(s) at a new year period. It is called hatsu-moude (初詣).  
I thought that hatsu-moude should be held on new year day or its later, but Sai-saki-moude intends to visit before new year day.

It has been advocated since 2021 due to avoid gathering to prevent COVID-19 pandemic[^sai-saki-moude].
I actually prefer staying in home on new year period. That is because almost shrines are going to be packed on that day especially in Tokyo area. I hope the style becomes more popular in the future.
