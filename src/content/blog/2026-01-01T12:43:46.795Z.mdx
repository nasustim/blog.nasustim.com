I thought my last year was rollercoaster. On last November, I reached 31 years old. Feeling time is going much more quickly than imagine when I was 20 yo. I should update my mind about facing time and tasks.

## Work

On early 2025, I moved to a new division in same company. The division is like a CVC [^cvc] and I got a managerial position in subsidary company.  
Almost my tasks are leading technical strategy and managing engineering team.  
Currently I rarely develop system by myself. Certainly it is because of significant growing of coding AIs though.

## Life

I love traveling. I went to Finland, Australia and Korea last year. These were enough to refresh my mind.

## Goals for 2026

- Take English exam including speaking test (like TOEIC S&W)
- Mastering a couple of new programming languages
