I thought my last year was rollercoaster. My role was significantly changed.
On last November, I reached 31 years old. Feeling time is going much more quickly than imagine when I was 20 yo. I should update my mind about facing time and tasks.

## Work

On early 2025, I moved to a new division in same company. The division is like a CVC [^cvc] and I got a managerial position in subsidary company.  
Current my tasks are leading technical strategy and managing engineering team. Nowaday I rarely develop system by myself[^ai].

Current position is quite challenging but I think it is crucial for my career.  
On the other hand, I feel a bit disapointment that opotunities of using English on the job are decreased.

## Travel

I went to Finland, Australia and Korea last year. These were enough to refresh my mind.

Wrote about Finland trip in the blog.

In Australia, I finally watch the penguins. I was so excited.
