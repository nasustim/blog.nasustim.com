I thought my last year was a roller coaster. My role was significantly changed.
Last November, I turned 31. Time feels like it is going much more quickly than I imagined when I was a child. I should update my mindset about facing time and tasks.

## Work

In early 2025, I moved to a new division in same company. The division is like a CVC [^cvc] and I got a managerial position in subsidary company.  
Currently, my tasks are leading technical strategy and managing engineering team. Nowaday I rarely develop systems by myself[^ai].

Current position is quite challenging but I think it is crucial for my career.  
On the other hand, I feel a bit of disappointment that opportunities of using English on the job are decreased.

## Travel

I went to Finland, Australia and Korea last year. These were enough to refresh my mind.

Wrote about Finland trip in the blog.

In Australia, I finally watch the penguins. I was so excited.
